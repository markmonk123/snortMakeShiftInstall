## Network Adapter Architecture

The system is designed around three network adapters:

```
Internet → [Incoming Port] → Snort3 Engine → [Offload Port] → Clean Traffic
                                  ↓
                          [Control Port] ← SSH/Management
```

1. **Incoming Adapter** (Onboard Ethernet)
   - Monitors all incoming traffic
   - Promiscuous mode enabled
   - Hardware offload disabled
   
2. **Offload Adapter** (USB Ethernet)
   - Forwards clean traffic in IPS mode
   - Normal operation mode
   
3. **Control Adapter** (Wireless)
   - Dedicated management interface
   - SSH and administrative access
   - Isolated from monitored traffic

## Installation Process

The installer performs these steps:

1. **Environment Check**: Verifies root privileges and detects environment
2. **Dependency Installation**: Installs all required packages via apt-get
3. **LibDAQ Build**: Downloads, compiles, and installs LibDAQ from source
4. **Snort3 Build**: Downloads, compiles, and installs Snort3 from source
5. **Network Configuration**: Configures all three adapters with appropriate settings
6. **Snort Configuration**: Creates IDS/IPS configuration file
7. **Service Setup**: Creates and enables systemd service
8. **Persistence**: Ensures settings survive reboots
9. **Verification**: Tests the installation

## Configuration Highlights

### Snort3 Configuration (`/etc/snort/snort.lua`)
- HOME_NET and EXTERNAL_NET definitions
- DAQ configuration for packet capture
- IPS engine with built-in rules
- Stream processing for TCP/UDP/ICMP
- Network traffic normalization
- Active responses for IPS mode
- Protocol-specific inspection (HTTP, etc.)
- Logging configuration

### Systemd Service (`/etc/systemd/system/snort3.service`)
- Type: simple (foreground process)
- Automatic restart on failure
- Network dependency management
- Security capabilities (CAP_NET_ADMIN, CAP_NET_RAW)
- Proper signal handling

### Network Persistence (`/etc/network/if-up.d/snort-network-config`)
- Automatic configuration on interface up
- Adapter-specific settings
- Promiscuous mode for incoming
- Ensures configuration survives reboots

## Deployment Scenarios Supported

### 1. Bare Metal
Direct installation on physical hardware with three network adapters.

### 2. Virtual Machine (VirtualBox/VMware)
Supports VM deployment with virtual network adapters configured appropriately.

### 3. Container (Docker/Podman)
Can run in privileged containers with host network mode for full network access.

## Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Auto-detect and install
sudo ./snort3_installer.py --auto

# Manual adapter specification
sudo ./snort3_installer.py --incoming eth0 --offload eth1 --control wlan0

# List available adapters
sudo ./snort3_installer.py --list-adapters

# Custom installation directory
sudo ./snort3_installer.py --auto --install-dir /opt/snort --config-dir /opt/snort/etc
```

## Security Features

- Systemd service runs with minimal capabilities
- Control adapter isolated from monitored traffic
- Promiscuous mode only on incoming adapter
- Proper error handling throughout
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure default configurations

## Code Quality

- **Python Best Practices**: PEP 8 compliant, proper typing hints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
- **Logging**: Detailed logging throughout installation process
- **Modularity**: Each installation step in separate method
- **Documentation**: Extensive inline comments and docstrings
- **Security**: CodeQL analysis passed with 0 alerts

## Testing

Installation can be verified with:
```bash
sudo ./test_installation.sh
```

This checks:
- Snort3 binary and version
- Configuration files
- Service status (enabled and running)
- Network adapters
- Log directories
- Required dependencies

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential areas for extension:
- Rule management system
- Web-based management interface
- Automated rule updates
- Alert notification system
- Integration with additional SIEM platforms
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Multi-instance support for load balancing

## Requirements Met

✓ Python executable for installation
✓ Snort3 installation and configuration
✓ IDS/IPS configuration
✓ Container/VM support
✓ Persistent settings
✓ Service startup configuration
✓ 3 network adapter support:
  - Ethernet (onboard) for incoming
  - USB Ethernet for offload
  - Wireless for control/management

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready solution for automated Snort3 deployment with proper network segmentation, persistence, and multi-environment support.
